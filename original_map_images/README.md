# Original map images used in the development of Cliopatria

These are the original historical map images developed by Andrew Tollefson in 2014.  They formed the basis of the initial Cliopatria data, as documented [here](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/24wd6). These map images where also used to create this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHG9uSOwx2A).

These PNG files are provided for reference only.  All Cliopatria GEOJSON releases incorporate many additional changes from these images both to the shapes and polity names based on reviews by historians.

The image file names follow the convention [B|C]*<sequence>-<year>*.PNG  where B indicates years BCE and C indicates years CE.  The *sequence* number is a 3-digit ascending sequence number within BCE and CE associated with *year*.  Thus B078-202.PNG indicates the map for 202BCE; C078-510.PNG indicates the map for 510CE.
