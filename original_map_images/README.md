# Original map images used in the development of Cliopatria

These are the original map images developed by Andrew Tollefson in 2014 that formed the basis of the initial Cliopatria data, as documented [here](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/24wd6). These map images also formed the basis of this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHG9uSOwx2A).

These images are included for reference only.  All Cliopatria GEOJSON releases incorporate many changes from these original images to the shapes and associated data, including names, as they are reviewed by historians.
